#Procedure Scheduling Application

### prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Maven 3 (http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/installation.html)
* Eclipse with the m2e plugin (m2e is installed by default when using the STS (http://www.springsource.org/sts) distribution of Eclipse)

Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in Help -> About dialog.
If m2e is not there, just follow the install process here: http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/

Steps to install:

1. Download and unzip zip file.

2. In Eclipse got to File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project 

3. Run the ProcSchedApplication.java in package com.scape.procscheduler as Java Application 

You can then access Procedure Scheduling App here: http://localhost:8080/


In its default configuration, Procedure Scheduling App uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which
gets populated at startup with data.
